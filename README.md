# Intruder Detection with TinyML Syntiant

![2 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58050803/203346037-1bc651c0-4809-4f99-aaa4-9a22425d4d26.jpg)

## The challenge

One of the challenges posed by this project is that glass breakage sounds can vary greatly, depending on the type and area of glass, as well as the environment in which it is broken. Another challenge is that glass breakage sounds can be short, so the system must be able to detect them quickly and reliably. Furthermore, these sounds can be faint, especially if the breaking occurs at a distance from the microphone.

## The solution

Our proposed solution uses Edge Impulse, a platform for developing and training machine learning models on embedded devices, and TinyML Syntiant, a low-power machine learning accelerator. Edge Impulse makes it easy to collect data, train models, and deploy them on embedded devices. 

## Conclusion

The intruder detection system with Syntiant TinyML can provide homeowners with peace of mind by constantly monitoring their homes for any suspicious activity. This system can be deployed on the edge, meaning that it can operate without the need for a constant internet connection. This is ideal for use in remote locations or areas with poor internet connectivity.
